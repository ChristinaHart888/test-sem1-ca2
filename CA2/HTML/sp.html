  <div class="row">
    <p class="text-dark col-lg-7 col-md-9 col-sm-12 mx-auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;The first difference here is immediatlly apparent on the first day of classes. And that is the sheer size of our campus. Back in secondary school, I could
      show up to school 5 minutes before class starts and be completely fine. But come poly life, I have to reach campus about 15 minutes in advance otherwise I would need to sprint all the way 
      to class in order to not be late. This is slightly augmented by the 15 minute grace period the school gives at the start of every class, but regardless, the extra walking distance to class
      is a very apparent difference from Secondary school to Polytechnic.</p><br>
      <p class="text-dark col-lg-7 col-md-9 col-sm-12 mx-auto">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, our classes are now much more flexible than as compared to back in secondary school, our lecturers can randomly cancel
      class for no apparent reason, and they often release us early, sometimes up to 2 hours before class is supposed to end. These changes were admittedly pretty jarring for a fresh secondary
      school graduate like myself, but I got used to it after a while, and honestly, I probably cannot go back to the life i once had in Secondary school.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;Another stark contrast to secondary school is the variety of food options to choose from in SP. There are 6 food courts to choose from, and a couple of others. As compared to
      secondary school with its 1 canteen, this is a stark contrast. Sure some of the food courts are really far away from my class, but now our break times are much longer. Back in secondary school, 
      our reccesses were only half an hour long, but now, they can go up to 2 hours long, sometimes even longer due to certain circumstances like cancelled lessons, as previously mentioned.
      For those who are interested, here are my opnions of the food courts around Singapore Polytechnic.
