            <p class="display-3">The Begining</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea first came up during a practice session for our oral O'Level Examination with our english teacher in the picture. When talking about our hobbies, on of
                my friends brought up playing Minecraft as a hobby. As the conversation went on, our teacher eventually gave us a challenge, which was to recreate the school in Minecraft after
                our O'Levels. Being the adventurous bunch that we are, we accepted her challenge.

            <p class="display-3">Fist Steps</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After O'levels, we initially didn't do much. After about a week or so, my team decided that it'll be a good time to start. One problem though, I didn't have a computer
                so the arrangement was for the team to build the school in minecraft first, to be used for our open house, and then once they are done, I'll handle the conversion from Minecraft 
                Java on the computer to Minecraft Bedrock edition for other devices such as phone, tablets, consoles, etc. and fix all the bugs that will inevitablely come out.

            <p class="display-3">Final Product</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With just a week left to the school's open house, our team pulled through and completed the build. We got a new member along the way, making the final team size 
                to 5 including myself. The open house was a massive success, with both graduates and Primary 6 students joining the world to check out the world. After the open house, I started 
                importing the world into bedrock edition as well as fixing the many bugs that appeared from the transition. This is no easy task ind you, as I had to replace all the doors, as they 
                were all bugged out, I also had to replace the entire rooftop and staircase as many of the stairs were facing the wrong direction. However, the work was eventually done, and the project
                was finally complete.

            <p class="display-3">Lunch with the team</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;To congradulate us for our hard work, my teacher invited the team for a lunch together. However due to the safe-distancing measures layed down by the government,
              we could'nt eat out together for a while. Once the restrictions were lifted, we finally came together, together with the folks who manage the server for the minecraft world, 
              whom I actually met for the first time, because I was not involved in the setting up for the open house event. Overall, I had a wonderful time during the lunch. We talked about
              our hobbies, we talked about our experiences with our teacher, it was a very fun time.

        <p class="display-3">Final Thoughts</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, i had a fantastic time with this project. Yes, it was very time consuming for me, but at the end of the day, I got to take part in something big for once.
          I ended primary school with a sour taste as I didn't have any friends, and was hated by many, even my teacher at that time. Thus, being able to end on such a high note in secondary 
          school, with good friends, and a huge acomplishment like this, it is very special to me, and I'll never forget the amazing times I had with my friends on this project.
