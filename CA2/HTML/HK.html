            <p class="display-3 mx-auto">Tofu Pizza</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day, we did not really do much, as we had to deal with checking in with the hotel, we only had time for a couple activity which was a tour at an organic farm
                and at the end of the day, making our own food using organic produce. The picture above shows the food that I made that day. I was trying to replicate a pizza using tofu, 
            and although I fail miserably, I still enjoyed the tour. The other activity was helping a non-profit charitable organisation to collect vegetables from markets and sorting them based on
          how fresh they were, and then giving back too the community by cooking meals for the elderly using said ingredients. Overall, my first day was rather tiring, but fufilling at the same time.</p>

            <p class="display-3 mx-auto">A Big Dam</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day, we went to the High Island Reservoir to get a closer look at how the dam worked, as well treking through the Reservoir, looking at wildlife, as well
                as learning about sedimentary rocks and the sea life that used to live there 200 million years ago. Overall, the seconds day very tiring, as we had to walk for a total of 6 hours,
                but I fell like it was worth it for the experience.

            <p class="display-3 mx-auto">Victoria Peak</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, we went sight-seeing around the city, one of the highlights of the day I would consider is the trip to Victoria Peak in Hong Kong Island. The bus
                ride up there alone took a good 30 minutes, but he payoff was worth it as the view up there was simply breathtaking, spectacular, and a sight to behold. All In all, I had an 
                excellent day up at victoria peak.

            <p class="display-3 mx-auto">Cable Car Ride</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day, we took a cable car up to the Big Budda Statue in Lantau Island. It was pretty rainy then, and thus oour view was slightly obstructed,
                nevertheless, the ride was absolutely pheonominal, it was leagues ahead of our offerings in Singapore in both length and scenic beauty. Then, at the budda statue, we had to climb
                up 268 steps to get a close up of the actual statue, and although it was tiring, the payoff was more than worth it. The wind up there was really strong, and it felt amazing to be
                up there. Would definitely go there again. Not so fun fact: The was actually the day that sparked the Hong Kong protests.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last day, we visited a local school where they gave us talks about their day to day life in school, as well as their environmental programms. The photo
              is the last I've seen of the hotel, as I wave Hong Kong goodbye, and appreciate it for the wonderful experiences and experiences that it gave me. Although the locals there didn't 
              speak thhe same language that I do, and they were sometimes pretty mean to foreigners like us, I still didn't regret my decision to come along for this trip, and I will never forget
              the times I spent, here in Hong Kong.
